# Reddit-NLP-Classifier
The goal of this project is to use NLP to classify Reddit posts from 2 subreddits: [OCPoetry](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry) and [shortscarystories](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/). This is the third project I did as part of the General Assembly [Data Science Immersive Bootcamp](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive-remote).
